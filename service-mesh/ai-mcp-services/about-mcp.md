# About MCP

## What is MCP

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Why MCP?

MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:

* A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
* The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
* Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure
