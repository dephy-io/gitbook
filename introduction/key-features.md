# Key features

## DePHY DID

DePHY ID implements a robust DID (Device Identifier) system for access control in IoT device interactions. This comprehensive system enables secure device-to-device communication across decentralized networks while providing signature-based message authentication that ensures traceability and integrity proofs. Through its verifiable identity management approach, the system significantly reduces trust costs, making it an efficient solution for large-scale IoT deployments.

## Messaging Layer

The Messaging Layer is an event-driven communication system that provides efficient and reliable support for distributed device management and payment interactions. Leveraging a decentralized messaging protocol (Nostr) and blockchain technology (Solana) enables real-time device state synchronization, payment validation, and system scalability.

## Liquidity Layer

Coming soon.

## Verification Layer

Verification layer represents a breakthrough in hardware validation for DePIN networks. This mechanism combines hardware attestation, performance metrics, and behavioral analysis to verify that participating devices are genuine physical infrastructure components rather than virtual simulations. By continuously monitoring device characteristics and operational patterns, the system maintains a high degree of confidence in the authenticity of network participants.
