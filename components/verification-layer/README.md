# Verification layer

Verification layer represents a breakthrough in hardware validation for DePIN networks. This mechanism combines hardware attestation, performance metrics, and behavioral analysis to verify that participating devices are genuine physical infrastructure components rather than virtual simulations. By continuously monitoring device characteristics and operational patterns, the system maintains a high degree of confidence in the authenticity of network participants.
