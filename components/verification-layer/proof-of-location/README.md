# Proof of location

The Proof of Location (PoL) mechanism is the foundational trust layer for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), verifying physical geographical coordinates and digital network positioning. Our system establishes device location by synthesizing satellite GPS data, third-party location services, and distributed node consensus, creating cryptographically-secure proofs anchored in multiple reality layers.
