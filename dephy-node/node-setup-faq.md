# Node Setup FAQ

**Q: How do we pay for the transaction cost or the worker registration fee? How is it going to change from testnet phase-1 -> testnet phase-2 -> Mainnet Beta?**

A: In testnet phase-1, as you can recall, the DePHY Team covered the gas fees for each worker/node registration cost and mining points by providing a seed-phrase with a small amount of funds.

For testnet phase-2, which will run for about a month until just before TGE, worker/node registration and point mining will be free of charge, so you can use an empty Solana wallet with no assets. (Your seed-phrase from testnet-1 will no loger require)

However, when the all testnet phase 1 & 2 end and Mainnet Beta begins, you must have a small amount of $SOL token in your connected Solana wallet address. Thanks to solanaâ€™s low transaction fees, having a small amount of sol in your wallet will be more than enough to cover all costs.

Finally, before 'Mainnet Beta', we will launch a mint dApp to register workers as DIDs, which will have a one-time fee (for minting DIDs, not for profit). 'Mainnet Beta' will require ALL workers to be registered on Solana before onboarding.

**Q: How long is the testnet migration period open? Will my testnet points automatically carry over to Testnet2?**

A: Testnet1 will continue until Testnet2 ends (a month long)) and through to the TGE & 'Mainnet Beta'. After migration, user points from testnet1 will be snapshot and saved and accumulated for the TGE stage, and you'll start with 0 points in the new testnet2. After TGE, all points accumulated across testnets will be combined, and 5% of the total token supply (allocated for testnet rewards) will be distributed proportionally based on users' total points.

**Q: Why aren't points updating in real-time on the migration page?**

A: Points are updated manually by the DePHY Team on a weekly basis. Please use https://status.dephy.app to check your points from testnet1.\
